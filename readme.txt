# Basic Tor Website design

This is a personal project that stemmed from my curiosity. I wanted to know if there were major differences and complexities between building a website in the clear net and one on the dark net.

## Getting Started

I used a virtual machine and installed Ubuntu 16.04 LTS. My choice of webserver was NGINX because it is considered more secure than APACHE to host an onion website. However, during my initial testing I used APACHE (XAMPP) to develop it on my computer before uploading to the virtual machine which worked perfectyl but right after changing to NGINX I runned into issues on executing .PHP files which were later not completely solved (I had to find a work around). So yeaa...

### Prerequisites

- Virtual Machine
- NGINX Web Server
- Ubuntu 16.04 LTS


### And coding style tests

On the website I used HTML with CSS. I wanted to built a basic but functional website
